# AdoPet

**History**

The company AdoPet aims to act as an intermediary between animal adopters and NGOs that focus on removing animals from the street. Aiming at this, it needs to bring more users and increase the interaction between potential adopters and representatives of these NGOs and for that, it wants to implement a platform and take the company to the digital world.

For this they are asking for our help as developers to create the site and the site must contain the following requirements:
- A home page that will be login, containing the buttons "I already have an account" and "I want to register".
- A registration page that will have a form asking for the information: name, e-mail and password.
- A login page with an email and password form.
- A page that should appear after login with a list of dogs and cats. Each animal must show a photo, name, age, size, characteristics and region. For each animal there will be a contact button.
- A message submission edit page, with a form with name, phone, animal name and message fields.
- Allow editing the profile, where it will also be possible to include a photo of the user.

**It is very important that the site is responsive** to give customers the ease of shopping through mobile devices.

We have a time frame of six weeks to develop the project and we will work with the agile development system using Trello as follows:

- The column "Ready to start" presents the cards with the elements not yet developed;
- The elements you are currently developing will be in the "Developing" column. When starting a task, you can move the card that contains the task to this column.
- In the "Paused" will be the elements that you started to develop, but not finished yet. For example, if you started developing a card task, but decided to pause to focus on another part of the project first;
- Finally, the "Completed" column will have the elements already completed.

Trello is a single-use tool for you to track the progress of your activities, but it will not be evaluated.
